The `tink_core` lib contains a set of lightweight tools for robust programming.

All modules are situated in `tink.core.*`. Some contain more than a single type. Generally, it is advisable to import the modules of this package through `using` rather than `import`. 

In addition, you can import all modules at once with `using tink.CoreApi;`.
